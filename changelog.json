    "1.12.2": {
        "0.1": "- Strong / weak soul, now Remnant / Vanilla soul: when joining a world for the first time, the player will be granted the choice between the mod\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death system or the vanilla death system.\n- Soul player state: if the player is a Remnant, upon death, his soul leaves his body, allowing a free roaming of the world in order to select a new body to inhabit.\n- Undead possession: completely re-written to be the most enjoyable possible, the undead possession system is here to stay. When in soul mode, you will be able to enter any undead monster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body and control them. This will give you access to their inventories, advantages but also inconveniences.
